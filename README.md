## Caution

Due to the new settings being available, the mod causes saves that make use of those settings to be dependent on the mod. It is recommended and necessary to save the game using unmodded values on both **Display Type** and **Pixel Size** before removing the mod.

Basically **use at your own risk!**

## Instructions

1. Download the **Apply-IntegerScalingTweaks.ps1** PowerShell script file and place it in the game folder.

2. Right click it and select **Run with Powershell**.

3. To remove the mod, revalidate game files through Steam to restore the original files.
