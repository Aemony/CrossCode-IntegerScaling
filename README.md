# CrossCode-IntegerScaling
Patch to add integer-based scaling method to CrossCode through a new custom display type called **Integer**, along with two new pixels sizes (5x and 6x; 6x is the optimal for 4K gameplay).

Why integer scaling? To prevent blur and/or shimmering that can otherwise result as a consequence as pixels are interpolated and doesn't fit evenly. See http://tanalin.com/en/articles/lossless-scaling/ for a better explanation. The idea came as a result of [this thread](https://steamcommunity.com/app/368340/discussions/0/1640915206443018918/) on the Steam Community forums, and previous requests made to add integer scaling to the game.

*Confirmed working with build ID 8583893 on Steam, manifest 2192574251112456041 of depot 368341 (dated 19 April 2022 â€“ 17:09:49 UTC). May or may not work with copies on other platforms.*


## Instructions

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Aemony/CrossCode-IntegerScaling/releases/latest) and extract the archive to the game folder.

2. Double click on the **Install-IntegerScaling.bat** file to execute the included PowerShell script file.

3. Launch the game and reconfigure it to use the new **Integer** display type as well as a fitting pixel size. It is recommended to restart the game to allow the change in pixel size to properly take effect.

   * If you are on a 4K display and there is no difference between 4, 5, and 6 in pixel size you need to add the `/force-device-scale-factor=1` command-line argument (aka "launch options" for Steam) to prevent the game from applying DPI scaling to the game window.

4. To remove the mod, double click on the **Uinstall-IntegerScaling.bat** file in the game folder.

5. The video settings menu can be made inaccessible after the mod have been removed if the save file still refer to the custom video options. Open the general settings menu and click the B key or **Reset all settings** to restore the original video settings to be able to access the video settings menu again.


## Changes to the original code

The patch changes the following code sections:

**assets\data\lang\sc\gui.en_US.json** - Added localization to the new video settings options
```
        "display-type": {
        	"name": "Display Type",
        	"group": ["Original", "Double", "Fit", "Stretch", "Integer"],
        	"description": "Changes the Scaling used for the box the game runs in."
        },
```
```
        "pixel-size": {
        	"name": "Pixel Size",
        	"group": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6"],
        	"description": "Higher size means sharper image. May reduce FPS. \\c[1]Needs a restart!"
        },
```

**assets\js\game.compiled.js**
*  sc.DISPLAY_TYPE - Added integer display type as an option:
 ```
        sc.DISPLAY_TYPE = {
        	ORIGINAL: 0,
        	SCALE_X2: 1,
        	FIT: 2,
        	STRETCH: 3,
        	INTEGER: 4
        };
```

* sc.PIXEL_SIZE - Added 5 and 6 as pixel size options.
  * Note this whole approach is not future-proof, and preferably the number of pixel sizes available should be determined by dividing the monitorWidth / 568 and monitorHeight / 320 and then flooring lowest value of the two.
```
        sc.PIXEL_SIZE = {
        	ONE: 0,
        	TWO: 1,
        	THREE: 2,
        	FOUR: 3,
        	FIVE: 4,
        	SIX: 5
        };
```

* _checkSystemSettings - Added a call to _setDisplaySize() (needed to properly apply the integer ratio on launch and when changing pixel size).
```
        } else if (a == "pixel-size") {
        	window.IG_GAME_SCALE = (this.values[a] || 0) + 1;
        	localStorage.setItem("options.scale", window.IG_GAME_SCALE);
        	this._setDisplaySize();
        }
```

* _setDisplaySize - Added a new case for the switch statement for handling integer scaling:
```
case sc.DISPLAY_TYPE.INTEGER:
	j = true;
	if (b > c * window.IG_GAME_SCALE && i > d * window.IG_GAME_SCALE) {
		a = c * window.IG_GAME_SCALE;
		b = d * window.IG_GAME_SCALE
	} else if (Math.floor(b / c) == 0 || Math.floor(i / d) == 0) {
		a = c;
		b = d
	} else {
		if (b / c < i / d) {
			a = c * Math.floor(b / c);
			b = d * Math.floor(b / c)
		} else {
		a = c * Math.floor(i / d);
		b = d * Math.floor(i / d)
		}
	}
	break;
```
